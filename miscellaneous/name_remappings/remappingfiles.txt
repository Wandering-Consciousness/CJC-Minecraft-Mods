These xml files can be used in IntelliJ IDEA to rename packages or classes from earlier versions of Forge to later versions.  Doesn't do method or field renames.
To use:
# Drop the XML file into your Intellij migrations directory.
#   This is usually <USER FOLDER>/.IdeaIC2018.3/config/migrations/ or similar.
#   If that file doesn't exist, use Refactor->Migration to create a new dummy migration with a distinctive name and then
#   search your user folder for it.
# Restart IntelliJ, then do Ctrl+Shift+A (to select all source code) -> Migrate -> Select the XML -> Run -> Do refactor
# MAKE SURE TO EXCLUDE THE miscellaneous\name_remappings folder, otherwise it will search-and-replace inside your xml files as well!

I haven't found anything online for mapping from 1.14 or 1.15 to 1.16, but I have created one by hand for 1.15.2 to 1.16.3 which will cover many of the common changes.

Other potential useful renames (from 1.12.2 to 1.14.4)

@SideOnly(Side.CLIENT)  --> @OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)

Minecraft.getMinecraft() --> Minecraft.getInstance()
