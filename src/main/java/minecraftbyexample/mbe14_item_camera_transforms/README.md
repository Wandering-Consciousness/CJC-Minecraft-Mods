# MBE14_ITEM_CAMERA_TRANSFORMS

When you create a custom item, you need to provide `ItemCameraTransforms` for it (the `display`) section in the item model json. 
I suggest you use BlockBench (https://blockbench.net/) to help you with that.
Alternatively this mod might also be helpful: [ItemTransformHelper](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/ItemTransformHelper)
