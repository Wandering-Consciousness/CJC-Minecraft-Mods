# MBE81_ENTITY_PROJECTILE

This example shows you how to create simple projectile entities-<br> 
1) Throwable entities - vanilla examples are Snowball, Egg<br>
2) Other Projectiles - vanilla examples are Arrow and LLamaSpit (both are IProjectiles)<br>

-------EmojiEntity (mbe81a) -------<br>
This can be thrown like a snowball, randomly producing either a happy face projectile or a grumpy face projectile.   The Entity contains an ItemStack which is used to render the projectile using a SpriteRenderer, i.e. it just draws the icon of the item, rotated to directly face the viewer.  When the projectile hits its target, it applies a potion effect.

The pieces you need to understand are located in:<br>

* `StartupClientOnly`, `StartupCommon`
* `EmojiItem`
* `EmojiEntity`
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\mbe81a_emoji_***_registry_name` -- defines the appearance of the item when held and when in flight
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\item\mbe81a_***.png` -- texture of the item icon and the rendered projectile in flight

## Key points to note:
You need to have:<br>
* RenderingRegistry.registerEntityRenderingHandler<br>
* public IPacket<?> createSpawnPacket() {return NetworkHooks.getEntitySpawningPacket(this);}<br>
*   public static void onEntityTypeRegistration(RegistryEvent.Register<EntityType<?>> entityTypeRegisterEvent) {...}<br>
If you forget any of these or get them incorrect, your code won't work and might fail silently.<br>
<br>
-------BoomerangEntity (mbe81b) -------<br>
This entity is a projectile that demonstrates two different ways of controlling the flight path of a projectile:<br>
1) Pre-programmed flight path (follow a fixed path in [x,y,z] coordinates)<br>
2) Ballistic motion, i.e. manipulate the velocity [vx,vy,vz] (called "motion" in the code) and adjust the position [x,y,z] every tick based
   on the velocity.<br>
<br>
The usage is as follows:<br>
1) The player holds a boomerang item in their hand<br>
2) The player holds down the right mouse button to "charge up" their throw, similar to a bow with arrow<br>
3) When the player releases the right mouse button, a boomerang entity is spawned.  For short charge-up time, the speed is slow and the boomerang does not travel far.  For long charge-up time, the speed is fast and the boomerang travels further.<br>
4) The boomerang entity starts off in "in flight" mode - it follows a pre-determined curved flight path (see boomerang_flight_path.png).  If the boomerang doesn't hit anything, it will curve back around to return to the player, who will catch it.<br>
5) If the flight path of the boomerang is interrupted, eg a) it hits something; or b) the player has moved and does not catch it;  then the boomerang changes to "not in flight" mode and behaves like a thrown object (falls to the ground)<br>
6) If the boomerang hits a block, it breaks the block.  Each time it breaks a block, it loses some of its momentum.  When the boomerang has no momentum left, it stops flying (bounces off the block).<br>
7) If the boomerang hits an entity, it causes damage to the entity and stops flying (bounces off)<br>
<br>
The entity can be enchanted with a number of different enchantments similar to bows, arrows, weapons.<br>
<br>
The model for the BoomerangEntity is a wavefront object;  Blockbench is also suitable for generating obj files.<br>
<br>
If you use Blender to generate wavefront (obj) files, you need to make sure that all faces are either quads or triangles (no "n-gons" > 4).<br>
If your obj file contains lines like this, you have a problem...<br>
f   60/7/2 150/8/2 157/9/2  15/10/2                 // 4 points = ok<br>
f 153/19/2 68/20/2 87/21/2 170/22/2                 // 4 points = ok<br>
f  75/1/1  150/2/1  60/3/1   11/4/1 59/5/1 151/6/1  // 6 points = will not render<br>
The easiest way to fix it is to select all faces (in edit mode) then:<br>
1) Triangulate faces; then
2) Tris to Quads<br>
<br>
Google is your friend here!<br>
<br>
Alternatively you can use BlockBench in "entity model" and export it as wavefront.<br>
<br>
Personally I find BlockBench easier to use when making the "blocky" style of minecraft models, and it's much easier to learn than Blender. <br>

The pieces you need to understand are located in:

* `StartupClientOnly`, `StartupCommon`
* `BoomerangItem`
* `BoomerangEntity`
* `BoomerangRenderer`
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\mbe81b_boomerang_charge_` -- slowly raises the height of the item while it is "charging up"
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\mbe81b_boomerang_registry_name_` -- defines the appearance of the item when held
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\item\mbe81a_***.png` -- texture of the item icon and the rendered projectile in flight

* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\entity\mbe81b_boomerang_wrapper.json` -- entity model wrapper for the wavefront model
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\entity\mbe81b_boomerang.obj` -- the wavefront model for the boomerang
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\entity\mbe81b_boomerang.mtl` -- the waverfront material file, contains the path to the texture 
map_Kd minecraftbyexample:model/mbe81b_boomerang_texture
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\model\mbe81b_boomerang_texture.png` -- the texture for the boomerang

## Common errors
* My entity doesn't appear on the client; no errors in the console<br>
You may have incorrectly implemented createSpawnPacket for your Entity

* My entity doesn't appear on the client; there is a renderinghandler not found error in the console<br>
Your renderer is not registered properly. 

Useful tips for debugging entity rendering:<br>
1) Does the entity exist on the client?  Put a breakpoint into YourEntity::tick()<br>
2) Press F3+B to show entity outline (hitbox) and facing direction<br>
3) WorldRenderer::updateCameraAndRender() breakpoint at the iprofiler.endStartSection("entities");<br>
--> entity is present, is associated with the correct renderer, is within the viewing frustrum, is at the [x,y,z] that you expect
