/**
 * Created by TheGreyGhost on 19/04/2015.
 * * Block3DWeb uses a model which
 *  - doesn't occupy the entire 1x1x1m space,
 *  - is made up of a central core, plus up to six "strands" radiating out from the core
 *  - can be waterlogged (filled with water) similar to a vanilla sign or fence
 *  We can walk over it without colliding, it slows the player like web does
 *
 * If the block is adjacent to another Block3DWeb, or to a solid surface, it joins to it with a strand of web.
 * The block has six true/false properties, one for each direction, to specify whether there is a strand in that direction
 *   or not.
 * These properties are then passed to the renderer, which uses the `multipart` blockstates format to draw each strand
 *   depending on whether the corresponding property is true or not.
 *
 * For example:
 * If the block to the east of the Block3DWeb is a solid stone block, then EAST property is true.
 * When rendering, the corresponding multistate property will draw the model for the web strand that connects to the east
 * mbe03b_block_3dweb_registry_name.json:
 *     {   "when": { "east": "true" },
 *       "apply": { "model": "minecraftbyexample:block/mbe03b_3dweb_east_model"}
 *     },
