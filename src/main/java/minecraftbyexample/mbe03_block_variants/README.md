# MBE03_BLOCK_VARIANTS

This example has two separate parts related to different ways of modifying your block's appearance based on its BlockState.

The first example (mbe03a) is a signpost which uses 'variants'.  The second example is a 3D Web which uses 'multipart'.
In both cases the blocks use BlockStateProperties to store the state of the block and to change the model which is used to render the block; the difference arises in the blockstate.json file:
The variants example uses the "variants" json format to select a single model from a list, based on the combination of blockstateproperties.  For example
- which way the sign is facing

The different colours of sign are not variants, they are each given their own BlockVariants instance and hence their own blockstates.json

In contrast, the second example (mbe03b) uses the "multipart" json format to add or remove multiple different parts of the model based on the blockstateproperties.
For example:
- If the UP property is true, include a strand of web pointing up
- If the EAST property is true, include a strand of web pointing east
- etc for all six directions

---mbe03a: variants -------<br>
The signpost has the following properties:
* doesn't occupy the entire 1x1x1m space,
* is made up of two pieces (the pole and a sign),
* uses a CUTOUT texture (with seethrough holes)
* has variants (can face in four directions, can be four different colours, and can be waterlogged (filled with water similar to vanilla sign or fence)

It will show you:

1. how to create a Block class with variants, and register it
1. how to define and register the model for rendering a block with variants
1. how to set the type of rendering for the block (SOLID, CUTOUT, TRANSLUCENT etc)
1. how to define and register the items corresponding to the different variants

The blocks will appear in the Blocks tab in the creative inventory.

The pieces you need to understand are located in:

* `StartupCommon` class
* `BlockVariants` class
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\lang\en_US.lang` -- for the displayed name of the block and items
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\blockstates\mbe03a_block_variants_****` -- for the blockstate definition
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\block\mbe03a_block_variants_****` -- for the models used to render the differnt block types
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\mbe03a_block_variants_***` -- the models for rendering the different block variants as an item
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\block\mbe03a_block_variants_sign_***` -- the textures used for the different sign colours

Useful vanilla classes to look at: `BedBlock`, `DoorBlock`, `ShulkerBoxBlock`

Miscellaneous notes:

* the mbe03_block_variants_model_shape defines the sign as "from": [4, 9, 8.01], "to": [12, 13, 8.01]. The reason for the 8.01 instead of 8 is to make sure that the sign renders just in front of the post. If you use 8, the post face and the sign face "fight" each other to be on top and this leads to weird striping / flickering at the overlap.
* the model_shape file also has the following for the sign--note the flipped north texture by using u values of 13-->4 for north instead of 4-->13
```
"faces": {
    "north": {"uv": [ 13, 3,  4, 7], "texture": "#sign"},
    "south": {"uv": [  4, 3, 13, 7], "texture": "#sign"}
}
```
* the sign textures have alpha channel information to make the signs pointy. You need a graphics editor which understands alpha channels in order to make textures like this. GIMP is a good free example.

------ mbe03b: multipart ---------<br>
The 3D web has the following properties:
* doesn't occupy the entire 1x1x1m space,
* is made up of a central core, plus up to six "strands" reaching out from the core to the edge of the cube: if the web block is adjacent to another Block3DWeb, or to a solid surface, it joins to it with a strand of web.
* can be waterlogged (filled with water similar to vanilla sign or fence)

It will show you:
1. how to create a Block class with multiple parts (similar to a fence or redstone wire), and register it
1. how to define and register the model for rendering a block with multiple parts

The block appears in the Blocks tab in the creative inventory
The pieces you need to understand are located in:

* `StartupCommon` class
* `Block3DWeb` class
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\lang\en_US.lang` -- for the displayed name of the block and items
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\blockstates\mbe03b_block_3dweb_registry_name` -- for the blockstate definition
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\block\mbe03b_3dweb_****` -- for the models used to render the differnet block types
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\mbe03b_block_3dweb_registry_name` -- the model for rendering the block as an item
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\block\mbe03b_block_3dweb` -- the textures used for the different sign colours

Useful vanilla classes to look at: <br>
* `FenceBlock` and `blockstates\birch_fence.json`
* `RedstoneWireBlock` and `blockstates\redstone_wire.json`

## Common errors

"Missing Model", "Missing texture", black and white textures etc:
These are caused when you have specified a filename or path which is not correct, typically:

1. you've misspelled it
1. the upper/lower case doesn't match
1. you've forgotten the resource domain, eg `blockmodel` instead of `minecraftbyexample:blockmodel`
1. the folder structure of your assets folders is incorrect

The model has the wrong shape or is textured strangely:
1. your model file is wrong
1. you haven't set the RenderType correctly using RenderTypeLookup.setRenderLayer() (eg CUTOUT, SOLID, TRANSLUCENT etc)

Blocks or Items don't register (don't appear in the game at all):
1. You've registered your event handlers on the wrong bus (see MinecraftByExample class for more detail)
1. You're registering MyEventHandler.class on the event bus, but your event handler methods aren't static.
  1. or... You're registering myEventHandler instance on the event bus, but your event handler methods are static.
1. You haven't specified a tab for the item, eg .group(ItemGroup.BUILDING_BLOCKS);  // which inventory tab?
