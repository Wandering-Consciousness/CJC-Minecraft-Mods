The redstone meter shows two techniques:
(1) how to access redstone power levels on the client side, to change the rendering of a block
(2) how to make a block which has power inputs and power outputs in the same block; including the use of block update ticks

For (1):
We want to change the appearance of our block based on the amount of redstone power it is receiving.
This can't be done directly during Model rendering because the methods are not provided with access to the World, they are
 methods are provided with an IBlockReader instead of a World; block rendering is multithreaded and
  is performed on a cached copy of the world, which only stores some of the information and has no direct access to
  weak power methods.
It could be done by storing the redstone power in a blockstate (similar to the BlockRedstoneColouredLamp).
The method we've used here is to use a TileEntity with stored information that is sent from server to client.  This is then
  used by the TileEntityRenderer  (or could alternatively be passed to the Block renderer using IForgeTileEntity.getModelData())

For (2):
The key thing to understand is that the block must store its power level somehow on the server side, due to the way that
  redstone power is propagated - in particular getWeakPower() is provided with IBlockReader not World;
  see here for further explanation http://greyminecraftcoder.blogspot.com/2020/05/redstone-1152.html.
  In this example, we use a TileEntity to store the power level information (similar to a ComparatorBlock and ComparatorTileEntity).

We use scheduled block updates for the flashing; a similar strategy is used by RepeaterBlock.
Alternatively, we could also have made our TileEntity implement ITickableTileEntity (so that the tick() method is
  called every tick) and counted the number of ticks.
