The two blocks in this package are redstone power sources; they provide power to other blocks.

The three key methods they use are
  public boolean canProvidePower(): true for blocks which are redstone power sources
  public int getWeakPower(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockAccess, BlockPos pos, Direction side):
    does this block provide weak power to an adjacent block? Note that side is the side of the acceptor block, not the donator

  public int getStrongPower(BlockState blockState, IBlockReader blockAccess, BlockPos pos, Direction side) {
    does this block provide strong power to an adjacent block?  Note that side is the side of the acceptor block, not the donator

  In vanilla, a block can accept strong power from strong power providers if Block.isNormalCube() is true.  By default this
    is only true for opaque blocks which can't provide power themselves.
